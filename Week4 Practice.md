# 🔧 Practical 4 – Docker Hub Integration (Push & Pull Images)

---

## 🎯 Objective

To push a Docker image to Docker Hub and pull it back for reuse, demonstrating image distribution and version management.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

* Docker Registry
* Image Tagging
* Docker Hub Authentication
* Image Push and Pull

---

## 🧪 Commands Used

### 🔹 Login to Docker Hub

```bash id="p4a1"
docker login
```

---

### 🔹 Tag Local Image

```bash id="p4a2"
docker tag mynginx:v1 <your-username>/mynginx:v1
```

---

### 🔹 Push Image to Docker Hub

```bash id="p4a3"
docker push <your-username>/mynginx:v1
```

---

### 🔹 List Local Images

```bash id="p4a4"
docker images
```

---

### 🔹 Remove Local Image (Optional Test)

```bash id="p4a5"
docker rmi <your-username>/mynginx:v1
```

---

### 🔹 Pull Image from Docker Hub

```bash id="p4a6"
docker pull <your-username>/mynginx:v1
```

---

### 🔹 Run Container from Pulled Image

```bash id="p4a7"
docker run -d -p 8082:80 <your-username>/mynginx:v1
```
